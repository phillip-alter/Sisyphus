Are you tired of endlessly pushing the boulder of your daily and weekly tasks up the hill of your memory? Sisyphus is here to help you keep track of that boulder. This addon provides a clean, movable, and easy-to-use to-do list for each of your characters.

## Features

* **Per-Character Lists:** Keep separate task lists for each of your characters.
* **Task Types:** Create one-time, daily, or weekly tasks.
* **Automatic Resets:** Dailies and weeklies automatically uncheck themselves after the corresponding server reset time for your region (NA/EU). No more manual unchecking!
* **Simple UI:** A clean, draggable list that fades when you're not mousing over it, keeping your screen clear.
* **Easy Management:** Quickly add, delete, and reorder your tasks.
* **Color-Coded:** Tasks are colored for at-a-glance recognition:
    * **One-Time Tasks** are green.
    * **Daily Tasks** are blue.
    * **Weekly Tasks** are purple.
    * Completed tasks are greyed out.

## How to Use

### Installation

1.  Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/phillip-alter/Sisyphus/releases), or from Curse.
2.  Unzip the folder.
3.  Copy the `Sisyphus` folder into your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns` directory.
4.  Restart World of Warcraft.

### Slash Commands

The addon is primarily controlled through slash commands.

| Command        | Alias  | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/Sisyphus`    | `/sis` | Toggles the main Sisyphus window to add new tasks.   |
| `/sis show`    |        | Shows the task list display.                         |
| `/sis hide`    |        | Hides the task list display.                         |
| `/sis reset`   |        | **Deletes all tasks** for the current character.     |
| `/sis help`    |        | Prints the list of available commands.               |

### Adding and Managing Tasks

1.  Type `/sis` to open the main window.
2.  In the text box, type the task you want to add (e.g., "Complete TWW Weekly").
3.  Check the "Daily" or "Weekly" box if applicable. You can only choose one. If neither is checked, the task will be a one-time task.
4.  Click the "Add Task" button.

Your new task will appear on the list display. From the list, you can:
* **Check the box** to mark a task as complete.
* Use the **`+` and `-` buttons** to move a task up or down the list.
* Click the **`X` button** to permanently delete a task.

The list display frame is movableâ€”just drag it wherever you like!

## A Note on Data

Please be aware that Sisyphus currently saves tasks on a **per-character basis**. Tasks you create on one character will not be visible on your alts. An account-wide list is on the future development roadmap!

## Future Plans (TODO)

* Larger number of characters allowed for a task (currently set to 15)
* Implement an optional account-wide task list.
* Add an option for completed tasks to automatically move to the bottom of the list.
* Allow the list frames to be resizable.
* Category support for better organization.
