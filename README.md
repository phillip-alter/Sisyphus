# Sisyphus
*A simple task list creator for your character(s) in World of Warcraft.*

Sisyphus is a lightweight, easy-to-use addon for creating and tracking character-specific to-do lists in World of Warcraft. Never forget a daily quest, weekly lockout, or a personal goal again.

## Features
* **Character-Specific Lists**: Each character gets their own unique task list.
* **Daily & Weekly Tasks**: Mark tasks as daily or weekly for automatic resets.
* **Automatic Resets**: Dailies and weeklies automatically uncheck themselves based on your server's region (NA or EU).
* **Draggable UI**: Move the main window and the task list wherever you like on the screen.
* **Dynamic Opacity**: The task list fades to a low opacity when you aren't mousing over it, keeping your screen clean. When you hover, the background and management buttons fade in.
* **Full Task Management**: Easily add, delete, and reorder tasks on your list.
* **Scrollable List**: The task list is fully scrollable, so you can add as many tasks as you need.

## How to Use
1.  **Open the Main Window**: Type `/sis` or `/Sisyphus` in chat to open the main control panel.
2.  **Add a Task**: In the text box, type the task you want to remember.
3.  **Set Task Type**: Check the "Daily" or "Weekly" box if the task should reset. Leave both unchecked for a standard, non-resetting task.
